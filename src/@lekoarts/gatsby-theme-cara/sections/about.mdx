## About

Born and raised in Brooklyn, NY I did not know what coding was or even knew anyone that was a software engineer. It wasn't until my junior year of college when I wrote my first line of code. Coding for me was not love at first sight, but rather a mystical art only the Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg's of the world could take been in. 

Piegoned holded to this belief, I tip toed around engineering until my close friend who was majored in Bio-chemsitry decided to give up becoming a doctor and become a software engineer instead. He would talk all about the wonders of code and how anyone could do it with time. 

Fast forward to now, I've been honing my engineering skills and seek to join a team that is working on amazing products. I can be reached on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neilwilliams9) or emailed at [Neil.Williams227@gmail.com]()
